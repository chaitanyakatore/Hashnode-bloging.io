    <h1>Debugging</h1>
<div>
Whenever I read or listen debugging word first word come to my mind is <b>'ERROR'</b>.Because debugging is the process of finding error in source code and fixing it.Sometimes debugging take more time than writting the code.In a large program that has thousands and thousands of lines of code, the debugging process can be made easier by using strategies such as 'UNIT TESTING', 'CODE REVIEWS' and 'PAIR PROGRAMMING'.  
To find the bug stand-alone debugger tool or debugger mode of the IDE. If developers aren't commenting when writing code, even the cleanest code can be a challenge for debugging.Debugging is an important part of determining why our program is not working properly.

<b> <h3> Debugging strategies</h3> </b>
<ui>

<li><b> Static analysis- </b>The developer test the code without executing the program.</li>
<li><b> Tracing-</b> The developer watches live print statements and monitors flow.</li>
<li><b> Remote debugging-</b> The developer's debugger runs on a different system than the program that is being debugged.</li>
<li><b> Post-mortem debugging-</b> The developer only stops to debug the program if it experiences fatal exceptions.</li>
